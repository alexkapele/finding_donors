### Description

In this project, different supervised learning techniques have been explored with the aim of developing a model that can accurately predict whether an individual is earning more than $50K/yr and is therefore more likely to donate money to a non-profit organisation. An AdaBoost classifier was chosen as the most applicable model for this application and was fine-tuned to reach an accuracy of 87% on the test dataset. 

### Data

The dataset used in this project is a modified version of the 1994 U.S. census dataset. It consists of approximately 32,000 datapoints, with 13 features each. The original dataset is hosted on [UCI Machine Learning Repository (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income).
